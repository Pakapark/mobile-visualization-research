# The Effectiveness of Visualizations Techniques on Mobile Devices for Time Dependent Data

In general, contemporary data visualization research for time de- pendent data focuses on the accuracy (how accurate an observer understands the data) and e ciency (how fast an observer under- stands the data) of two techniques: animation and small multiple. However, none of this research takes in account the screen space requirements in visualizing these two techniques. In this paper, we will address and experiment similar techniques (slider graph and small multiple) while considering screen space. Our experiment yields a surprising result that, with 95% con dence, slider graph is signi cantly more accurate than small multiple to convey the numerical detail of the data in mobile device.
